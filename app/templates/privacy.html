            <p class="mb-4">Your privacy is important to us. It is WildFares' policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We collect minimal information to provide and improve our Service.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may log information about how you use our site, such as the pages you visit, the search queries you perform, and your IP address. This helps us monitor system performance, prevent abuse, and improve the user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use cookies (small data files) solely for essential website functionality (such as remembering your preferences). We do not use cookies for tracking or advertising purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">2. How We Use Information</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>To operate and maintain the Service.</li>
                <li>To improve our search algorithms and user interface.</li>
                <li>To monitor usage trends and prevent fraudulent activity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">3. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to any other entity. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners and trusted affiliates.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We do not share your specific search queries with airlines or third parties, except as necessary to technically fulfill a request (e.g., if we were to integrate a direct booking API, which we currently do not; we simply link you to the airline's website).</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">4. Security</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4 mt-8">5. Third-Party Websites</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Our Service links to third-party websites (e.g., Frontier Airlines). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any website you visit.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
